# 8/5/2020 Tournament Game

players = []

userInput = input("Enter a name\n")
print(userInput)



# users will be able to add as many participants as they want for the firs phase
# for the next phase, it will automatically number them #0 through etc.
# the user should be able to edit or delete any of them should they choose to do so, and the table will adjust accordingly
# when they are satisfied, they can begin the tournament.
# the program will grab two random values in the players array and ask the user which they prefer and they'll discard the other (perhaps into an alternative array)
# there should also be scoring. The more a value wins, the higher its score. The second array can help check the scores of the previous losses that had potential
# when complete, all values will be printed side-by-side with their scores, like so:
## alpha   - 20
## bravo   - 10
## charlie - 5
